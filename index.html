            <p>It was my first song that I love the most and was the first song that I play on repeat
                and even today also I play it multiple time and still find it fresh
                <br>
                <br>
                Charlie Puth’s vocals are smooth but sharp, packed with just enough frustration and charm to make the lyrics cut deep.
                The production? Clean, funky, and addictive—especially that drop after the chorus. It makes you want to move, but also think.
                <br>
                <br>
                This song always reminds me of how people play games with emotions—but it also makes you feel like you’re in control once you realize it.
                It’s a track I keep coming back to, whether I need a confidence boost or just want something with a groove that hits right.

            <p>This is the yet another track that I find interesting to listen and if this song was on spotify then in my 
                spotify capsule it would be the song alway in the most repeted song of the month and I would be someone who would love to add this song 
                on the favorite playlist.
                <br>
                <br>
                What's best about this song is the sound that have been used here that makes it more better to listen. The scent of cry and beg 
                You can somehow feel the despiration in the song that you are someone in my life and a question that was it a joke or something.
                <br>
                <br>
                And I guess the songs like this would be the biggest reason why people will like to unite and this feeling of unition makes me feel happy the most.

            <p>Oh damn! if there is something that I like about Kpop is this song. The only first question that I have with the artist is that how the hell you are a
                able to pull of such songs. 
                <br>
                <br>
                This song is really something that need to be focussed on cause it is like a sweet lullaby.
                <br>
                <br>
                This song have such a pure melody and the better arrengement of the instruments
